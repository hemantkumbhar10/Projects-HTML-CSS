                <p><span class="name">Leonardo da Vinci</span>, (Italian: “Leonardo from Vinci”) (born April 15, 1452, Anchiano, near Vinci, 
                    Republic of Florence [Italy]—died May 2, 1519, Cloux [now Clos-Lucé], France), Italian painter, 
                    draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose skill and intelligence, perhaps more than that
                    of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. His Last Supper (1495–98) and Mona 
                    Lisa (c. 1503–19) are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance. His 
                    notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead 
                    of their time.The unique fame that Leonardo enjoyed in his lifetime and that, filtered by historical criticism, 
                    has remained undimmed to the present day rests largely on his unlimited desire for knowledge, which guided all his 
                    thinking and behaviour. An artist by disposition and endowment, he considered his eyes to be his main avenue to knowledge; 
                    to Leonardo, sight was man’s highest sense because it alone conveyed the facts of experience immediately, correctly, 
                    and with certainty. Hence, every phenomenon perceived became an object of knowledge, and saper vedere (“knowing how to 
                    see”) became the great theme of his studies. He applied his creativity to every realm in which graphic representation 
                    is used: he was a painter, sculptor, architect, and engineer. But he went even beyond that. He used his superb intellect, 
                    unusual powers of observation, and mastery of the art of drawing to study nature itself, a line of inquiry that allowed 
                    his dual pursuits of art and science to flourish.</p>
